abstract: "Establishing correlations among common inhibition tasks such as Stroop or flanker tasks has been proven quite difficult despite many attempts.  It remains unknown whether this difficulty occurs because inhibition is a disparate set of phenomena or whether the analytic techniques to uncover a unified inhibition phenomenon fail in real-world contexts.  In this paper, we explore the field-wide inability to assess whether inhibition is unified or disparate. We do so by showing that ordinary methods of correlating performance including those with latent variable models are doomed to fail because of trial noise (or, as it is sometimes called, measurement error).  We then develop hierarchical models that account for variation across trials, variation across individuals, and covariation across individuals and tasks.  These hierarchical models also fail to uncover correlations in typical designs for the same reasons.  While we can characterize the degree of trial noise, we cannot recover correlations in typical designs that enroll hundreds of people.  We discuss possible improvements to study designs to help uncovering correlations, though we are not sure how feasible they are."

In 1957, Lee Cronbach gave a presidential address to the American Psychological Association where he advocates merging two major but separate traditions in research psychology [@Cronbach.1957].  One was termed the *correlational tradition*, and it referred to the rapid advances in psychometrics and scaling at the time.  The other was the *experimental tradition,* which is readily recognizable in this journal and several others.  Although these traditions remain largely separate today, one area where there has been substantial merging is the study of individual differences in cognitive control. Individual-difference studies often include true experimental tasks such as the Stroop task [@Stroop:1935], the Simon task [@Simon:1968], and the Flanker task [@Eriksen:Eriksen:1974].  On the face of it, individual-difference researchers should be sanguine about using such tasks for the following reasons:  First, many of these tasks are designed to isolate a specific cognitive process, such as cognitive control, and they do so by contrasting specific conditions.  For example, in the Stroop task, the score is the contrast between performance for incongruent and congruent conditions.  The subtraction inherent in the contrast controls for unrelated sources of variation such as overall speed.  Second, many of these tasks are robust in that the effects are easy to obtain in a variety of circumstances.  Take again, for example, the Stroop task.  The Stroop effect is so robust that it is considered universal [@MacLeod:1991].  Third, because these tasks are laboratory based and center on experimenter-controlled manipulations, they often have a high degree of internal validity. Fourth, because these tasks are used so often, there is usually a large literature about them to guide implementation and interpretation.  Fifth, task scores are relatively easy to collect and analyze with latent-variable models.  

Before going on, we ask the reader to draw a sharp distinction between a *task* and a *measure.*   Tasks are true experiments where Donders' subtractive logic [@Donders.1868] is used to localize a process of interest. Two conditions are constructed where the only difference between them that is that the process of interest loads more highly on to one than the other.  The contrast of the conditions allows for a measure of the process free from nuisance factors. Measures are instruments that do not have conditions nor use Donders' subtraction method. Good examples of measures are the the anti-saccade accuracy measure [@Kane.etal.2001], the N-back memory measure [@Cohen.etal.1994], and the stop-signal measure [@Logan.Cowan.1984;@Verbruggen.etal.2019].  Measures typically reflect the composite of several skills and processes including but not limited to cognitive control.  For example, obtaining high accuracy in the antisaccade measure requires not only suppression of the prepotent orienting response to the cue, but also speed in moving ones eyes and speed in target identification.  In our usage, measures are not true experiments.  They do not have an associated experimental manipulation and a contrast.  Moreover, the claim that they index a particular process is made *prima facie* and without recourse to experimental logic.  This does not mean that the claim is undesirable.  It does mean that it is up to researchers to assess the claim by their own standard for appropriateness as there is no underlying experimental logic.

Figure \ref{fig:usual} shows the usual course of analysis in individual-difference research with cognitive tasks.  There are raw data (Panel A), which are quite numerous, often on the order of hundreds of thousands of observations.  These are cleaned, and to start the analysis, task scores for each participant are tabulated (Panel B).  For example, if Task 1 is a Stroop task, then the task scores would be each individual's Stroop effect, that is, the difference between the mean RT for incongruent and congruent conditions.  A typical task score is a difference of conditions, and might be in the 10s of milliseconds range.  The table of individual task scores is treated as a multivariate distribution, and the covariation of this distribution (Panel C) is decomposed into meaningful sources of variation through latent variable models [Panel D; e.g., @Bollen:1989;@Skrondal:Rabe-Hesketh:2004].

The above latent-variable approach to individual differences has been successful in some domains, such as personality, where rich factor structures are used to capture individual differences [@Ashton:etal:2004;@McCrae:Costa:1997].   Indeed, it seemed some twenty years ago that the same strategy would succeed in cognitive control [@Miyake:etal:2000;@Kane:Engle:2003].  Yet, the latent-variable approach has not lived up to the promise, at least not in our opinion.  Scores from experimental tasks correlate with one another far less than one might think *a priori.*   Take the correlation between Stroop and flanker tasks, two popular tasks for measuring inhibition.  Table \ref{tab:corTab} shows some published values from the literature.  As a rule, effects in inhibition tasks (as opposed to measures) show low correlations [@ReyMermet:etal:2018].  Indeed, even if we cherry pick the high end of these correlations, we tend not to find values about .3.


```{r 'example', child="example.Rmd"}
```


The question of why these correlations are low has been the subject of recent work by @Draheim:etal:2019, @Hedge:etal:2018 and @ReyMermet:etal:2018 among others.  On one hand, they could reflect underlying true task performance that is uncorrelated or weakly correlated.  In this case, the low correlations indicate that performance on the tasks do not largely overlap, and that the tasks are indexing different mental processes.  Indeed, this substantive interpretation is taken by @ReyMermet:etal:2018, who argue that inhibition should be viewed as a disparate rather than a unified concept.  By extension, different tasks rely on different and disparate inhibition processes.   

On the other hand, the true correlations could be large but masked by measurement error.  Several authors have noted the possibility of a large degree of measurement error.  @Hedge:etal:2018, for example, set out to empirically assess the reliability of task measures by asking participants to perform a battery of tasks and to return three weeks later to repeat the battery.  With these two measures, @Hedge:etal:2018 computed the test-retest reliability of the tasks.  The results were somewhat disheartening with  test-retest reliabilities for popular tasks in the range from .2 to .7.  @Draheim:etal:2019 argue that commonly used response time difference scores are susceptible to low reliability and other artifacts such as speed-accuracy tradeoffs.

It has been well known for over a century that correlations among measures are attenuated in low reliability environments [@Spearman:1904a].  Yet, how much attenuation can we expect?  If it is negligible, then the observed low correlations may be interpreted as true indicators that the tasks are largely measuring uncorrelated mental abilities.  But if the attenuation is sizable, then the underlying true correlation remains unknown.  One of our contributions in this paper is to document just how big this attenuation is in common designs.  

Figure \ref{fig:example} provides an example of attenuation.  Shown in Panel A are hypothetical *true  difference scores* (or true effects) for 200 individuals on two tasks.  The plot is a scatter plot---each point is for an individual; the x-axis value is the true score on one task, the y-axis value is the true score on the other task.  As can be seen, there is a large correlation, in this case it is `r round(true.cor,2)`. 
Researchers do not observe these true scores; instead they analyze difference scores from noisy trial data with the tabulation shown in Figure\ \ref{fig:usual}. Figure \ref{fig:example}B shows the scatterplot of these observed difference scores (or observed effects). Because these observed effects reflect trial noise, the correlation is attenuated. In this case it is `r round(obs.cor,2)`.  While this correlation is statistically detectable, the observed value is dramatically lower than the true one.   

The amount of attenuation of the correlation is dependent on critical inputs such as the number of trials and the degree of trial  variability.  Therefore, to get a realistic picture of the effects of measurement error it is critical to obtain realistic values for these inputs.  In this paper, we survey 15 fairly large inhibition studies.  From this survey, presented here subsequently, we derive typical values for the number of trials and the degree of trial variability.  These typical values are used in Figure\ \ref{fig:example}, and the amount of attenuation of the correlation therefore represents a typical rather than a worst-case scenario.  As will be discussed, we believe that observed correlations in typical designs are less than 1/2 of the true values.

# Measurement Error and Trial Noise

The amount of attenuation shown in Figure\ \ref{fig:example}, from `r round(true.cor,2)` to `r round(obs.cor,2)`, is striking.  No wonder it has been so hard to find correlations!  What can be done?  Our view is that there is a productive path by considering what contributes to measurement error [@Rouder:Haaf:2019a].  Consider the workflow in Figure \ref{fig:usual} where the first analytic step is forming participant-by-task-score tables (Panel B).  It is these scores that are susceptible to measurement error.  But where does this error come from?  The score is the differences in sample means, and the measurement error of these sample means is a function of the number of trials in the task.  If there are a great many trials, then the sample means precisely estimate true means, sample differences precisely estimate true differences, and the correlation reflects the true correlation among the tasks.  If there are few trials, then the sample means are variable and the observed correlation is attenuated.  Hence, the number of trials per task is a critical quantity as it determines the systematic downward bias in correlation.

There are two immediate consequences to noting that the main component of measurement error is trial noise [@Rouder:Haaf:2019a].  The first is that one cannot talk about the reliability of a task or the correlation among two tasks.  These values are critically dependent on the number of trials.  We cannot compare different values from different experiments without somehow accounting for differences in this design element.  Simply put, there is no such thing as the reliability of a task or a correlation between tasks without reference to sample sizes.  The second consequence is that the number of trials is far more important than the number of participants.  The number of participants determines the unsystematic noise in the correlation; the number of trials determines the systematic downward bias.  With few trials per task and many participants, researchers will have high confidence in a greatly biased estimate.

The realization that measurement error is primarily trial noise is wonderful news!  It means that measurement error potentially may be overcome by running many trials per participant per condition per task.  Even more importantly,  trial noise can be estimated and perhaps removed using statistical techniques.  The hope is that with such techniques, it may be possible to obtain unbiased estimates of the correlations even in realistic designs with limited numbers of trials per person per task.  For example, @Behseta:etal:2009, @Haines.etal.2020, @Matzke:etal:2017, @Rouder:Haaf:2019a, and @Whitehead.etal.2020 each propose hierarchical models to disattenuate correlations.  The potential of such models is shown in Figure \ref{fig:example}C.  Here, a hierarchical model, to be discussed subsequently, was applied to the data in \ref{fig:example}B, and the resulting posterior estimates of participants' effects reveal the true strong correlation.  

Based on the demonstration in Figure \ref{fig:example}C, we had come into this research with the hope of telling a *you-can-have-your-cake-and-eat-it* story.  We thought that perhaps hierarchical models would allow for the accurate recovery of correlations in typical designs providing for an answer to whether cognitive control is unified or disparate.  Yet, the story we tell here is far more complicated.  First, we study 24 previously-published experiments to characterize the amount of measurement noise, true variability, and sample sizes in typical designs in inhibition-task research with individual differences.  With these inputs, we then study correlation recovery through simulation.  To foreshadow, overall estimates from hierarchical models do disattenuate correlations.  But, in the course, they suffer from a large degree of imprecision.  It seems that in typical designs, one can use sample statistics and suffer massive attenuation or use a  modeling approach and accept a large degree of imprecision.  And this difficulty is why we believe most studies of individual differences with tasks are doomed to fail.   This story is not the one we had hoped to tell.  It would have been much better for us if we could show that the models we advocate solve critical problems.  But we cannot. And the inability to recover correlations even with the most sophisticated statistical approaches is an important story for the community of individual-differences scholars. 

# Spearman's Correction for Attenuation

Before addressing the main question about recovery, we consider the @Spearman:1904a correction for the attenuation of correlation from measurement error.  In this brief detour, we assess whether Spearman's correction leads to the recovery of latent correlations among tasks in typical designs.  The assessment provides guidance because the data generation in simulations match well with the assumptions in Spearman's correction.  If Spearman's correction cannot recover the latent correlations in realistic designs, these correlations may indeed be unrecoverable.

Spearman's derivation comes from decomposing observed variation into true variation and  measurement noise.  When reliabilities are low, correlations may be upweighted to account for them.  In Spearman's classic formula, the disattenuated correlation, denoted $r'_{xy}$ between two variables $x$ and $y$ is
\[
r'_{xy} = \frac{r_{xy}}{\sqrt{r_{xx}r_{yy}}},
\]
where $r_{xy}$ is the sample correlation and $r_{xx}$ and $r_{yy}$ are the sample reliabilities.[^samp.rel] 

[^samp.rel]: The estimation of reliability in tasks is different than the estimation of reliability in a classical test because there are replicates within people and conditions in tasks.  The presence of these replicates may be leveraged to produce better estimates of error variability than when they are not present.  Let $\bar{Y}_{ik}$ and $s_{\bar{y}_{ik}}$ be the sample mean and sample standard error for the $i$th individual in the $k$th condition, $k=1,2$.  Let $d_{i}=\bar{Y}_{i2}-\bar{Y}_{i1}$ be the effect for the $i$th individual, and let $V_d$ be the sample variance of these effects.  This sample variable is the total variance to be decomposed into true and error variances.  Assuming an equal number of trials per condition, the error variance for the $i$th person, denoted $V_{ei}$ is $s^2_{\bar{y}_{i1}}+s^2_{\bar{y}_{i2}}$.  The estimate of error variance is simply the average of these individual error variances, or $V_e=\sum_i\sum_k s_{\bar{y}_{ik}}^2/I$.  The reliability is $r=(V_d-V_e)/V_d$.

Spearman's correction, while well known, is not used often.  The problem is that it is unstable.  Panel D of Figure \ref{fig:example} shows the results of a small simulation based on realistic values from inhibition tasks discussed subsequently.  The true correlation is .80.  The Spearman-corrected correlations, however, are not only variable ranging from `r round(min(spearCor), 2)` to `r round(max(spearCor), 2)`, but not restricted to valid ranges.  In fact, `r 100*round(mean(spearCor>1),3)`% of the simulated values are greater than 1.0.   We should take these problems with Spearman's correction seriously.  The poor results in  Figure \ref{fig:example}D may indicate that in low-reliability environments, true correlations among tasks may not be recoverable.  And this lack of recoverability may be fundamental---measurement noise may destroy the correlation signatures.

In this paper, we explore the recoverability of correlations in inhibition experimental tasks.  We make our main claims by simulating data from known structures and then trying to recover signatures from experimental data.  For these simulations to be useful, they must simulate data that have representative levels of true individual variation and of true trial noise.   In the next section, we analyze existing data sets to find appropriate settings for simulations.  With these settings established, we simulate data and assess whether correlations are recoverable. The hierarchical latent correlation estimators, while far from perfect, are better than Spearman-corrected correlation estimators.  Subsequently, we apply the same analysis to a large data set from @ReyMermet:etal:2018 spanning four inhibition tasks to assess whether the observed low correlations reflect independent task performance or attenuation from trial noise.  Yet, even with hierarchical modeling, we are unable to definitively answer this question.

# Variability in Experimental Tasks


```{r 'oneTask', child="oneTask.Rmd",eval=TRUE}
```


# Expected Attenuation

The above results are useful for understanding how much attenuation of the correlations we should expect with the usual analysis in Figure \ref{fig:usual}.  We consider the case where in each task there are $L$ trials per task per condition, common trial variance $\sigma^2$ and common true variance $\sigma^2_\theta$.  The expected classical estimate, $\rho^*$, is given by 
\[
\rho^* = \rho\left(\frac{L\sigma^2_\theta}{L\sigma^2_\theta+2\sigma^2}\right).
\]
This equation is most useful if written with the ratio $\eta=\sqrt{\sigma_\theta/
\sigma}$, with this ratio interpreted as a ratio of signal (true variability) to noise (trial noise).  Then, the attenuation factor, $\rho^*/\rho$ is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fid}
\frac{\rho^*}{\rho} = \left( \frac{L}{L+2/\eta^2}\right).
\end{equation}
\]
The last column of Table \ref{tab:metaTab} shows the value of $\eta$ for the various studies, and the values range from 1/11 to 1/3, with $\eta=1/8$ corresponding to our typical case.  Figure \ref{fig:attenuate} shows the dependence of the attenuation factor on the number of trials ($L$) for various values of signal to noise.  As can be seen, with the usual approach of tabulating participant-by-task scores, we expect attenuation to be a factor of .44 for $L=100$ replicates.

```{r attenuate, fig.cap="Attenuation of correlation as a function of number of trials ($L$) and signal-to-noise ratio $\\eta$.  For typical values ($L=100$, $\\eta$=1-to-8), the attenuation is a factor of 44. The plotted values of $\\eta$ are 1-to-5, 1-to-6.5, 1-to-8, 1-to-9.5, and 1-to-11."}

# Model-Based Recovery of Correlations Among Tasks

The critical question is then whether accurate estimation of correlation is possible.  The small simulation in the introduction, which was based on the above typical settings for two tasks and a true population correlation of .80, showed that naive correlations among sample effects were greatly attenuated and Spearman's correction was unstable.  We now assess the recoverability of true latent correlations with the hierarchical models used to simulate data and for several values of true correlations.

## A Hierarchical Model for Correlation

Here we develop a hierarchical trial-level model for many tasks that explicitly models the covariation in performance among them.  A precursor to this model is provided in @Matzke:etal:2017 and @Rouder:Haaf:2019a.  A similar mixed-linear model is provides in @Whitehead.etal.2020.  The difference is that these previous models are applicable for only two tasks and one correlation coefficient.  They are not applicable to several tasks and coefficients.

At the top level, the model is:
\[
Y_{ijk\ell} \sim \mbox{Normal}(\alpha_{ij}+x_k\theta_{ij},\sigma^2).
\]
The target of inquiry is $\theta_{ij}$ the effect for the $i$th participant in the $j$th task.  The specification is made easier with a bit of vector and matrix notation.  Let $\bftheta_{i}=(\theta_{i1},\ldots,\theta_{iJ})'$ be a column vector of the $i$th individual's true effects.  This vector comes from a group-level multivariate distribution.  The following is the case for three tasks:

\[
\bftheta_i=\begin{bmatrix} \theta_{i1}\\ \theta_{i2} \\ \theta_{i3}\end{bmatrix} 
\sim \mbox{N}_3 \left( \begin{bmatrix} \mu_1\\\mu_2\\\mu_3\end{bmatrix},

More generally, for $J$ tasks, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Sig}
\bftheta_i \sim \mbox{N}_J(\bfmu,\bfSigma_\theta).
\end{equation}

Priors are needed for $\bfmu$, the vector of task means, and $\bfSigma_\theta$, the covariance across the tasks.  We take the same strategy of using scientifically-informed priors.  For $\bfmu$, we place the normal in Figure\ \ref{fig:theta}A on each element.  For $\bfSigma_\theta$, the classic choice is the *inverse Wishart* prior.  This choice is popular because it is flexible and computationally convenient [@OHagan:Forster:2004].  The inverse Wishart requires a scale parameter, and we set it so that the marginal prior on standard deviations of true variation matches the distribution in \ref{fig:theta}B.[^lkj]  It is the use of the inverse Wishart here that allows the model to be applicable to many tasks and correlation coefficients.  

[^lkj]: There is an alternative choice of prior for covariance that we extensively explored, the *LKJ prior* [@Lewandowski:etal:2009].  This prior is less informative than the Wishart because, unlike the Wishart, the estimation of correlation is independent of the specification of scale.  Consequently, this prior is  recommended [@McElreath:2016], and implementation is convenient in the `R`-package `rstan` [@rstan:2018].  Yet, we found better performance for the inverse Wishart in simulations in that the posterior credible intervals were smaller and better covered the true value.  The increased performance of the Wishart reflects the fact that researchers have a rough idea about the scale of individual differences---it is on the order of tens of milliseconds---and this is enough information for the improved performance of the inverse Wishart.

# General Discussion

A basic question facing researchers in cognitive control is whether inhibition is a unified phenomenon or a disparate set of phenomena.  A natural way of addressing this question is to study the pattern of individual differences across several inhibition tasks.  In this paper, we have explored whether correlations across inhibition tasks may be recovered.  We consider typically large studies that enroll hundreds of participants and run tasks with 100s of usable trials per condition.  The answer is largely negative---correlations are difficult to recover with accuracy that would allow for a definitive answer to this basic question.  This statement of poor recovery holds for hierarchical models that are extended to the trial level.  

Why this depressing state-of-affairs occurs is fairly straightforward.  Relative to trial noise, there is little true individual variation in inhibition tasks.  To see why this is so, consider an average effect, say one that is 60 ms.  In inhibition tasks like Stroop and flanker, we can safely make a *dominance assumption*---nobody truly has a negative effect [@Haaf:Rouder:2017].  That is to say nobody truly identifies incongruent stimuli faster than congruent ones.  Under this assumption, where all true scores are positive, a small mean necessarily implies a small variance.  For example, if true Stroop effects are reasonably normally shaped, the mean is 60 ms and there can be no mass below zero, then an upper bound on variability across true scores is a standard deviation of 25 ms or so.  This is a small amount of variation compared to trial variability, which is typically 8 times larger.  This small degree of true variation necessarily implies a small degree of covariation across tasks.  And this small degree of covariation is beyond the resolution of our experimental designs, and that is why our data are difficult.

We believe this problem of localizing individual differences and correlations extends beyond inhibition tasks.  It likely holds broadly in most task domains as most tasks have relatively small effects, whether on the order of 60 ms for RT, on the order of .08 for accuracy, or maybe on the order of 1/10th of the scale for Likert values.  If we make a dominance assumption---each individual has a true effect in the same direction---then there cannot be much individual variability else these mean effects would be larger.  And measuring correlations with small degrees of individual variability may be beyond the resolution of typical designs.

## Recommendations

Based on the above correlation-recovery results, we can make the following recommendations:

*Be mindful of attenuation*.  Researchers have certainly been aware of measurement error and understand the link between measurement error and attenuation.  Yet, in our view, they have not asked the tough questions.  Can correlations be estimated in low and medium reliability environments?  Can the factor structures be accurately recovered in low-reliability environments?  How difficult is it to conclude that there is a lack or a small correlation in such environments?  Previous to this work, there were no systematic studies of the degree of attenuation, and hence little basis to understand its effects.  Here, we argue that the critical factor---the ratio of true variability to trial noise---is on the order of 1-to-8, and may be as great as 1-to-11.  Now, for various numbers of trials, researchers can compute how much attenuation is expected using Equation (\ref{eq:fid}).  These values can be used for sample size planning and as context in interpretation.  

*Stress the number of trials in a task*.  Typically, researchers are quick to report the number of participants they have run.  These numbers appear not only in method sections, but in abstracts and tables.  And researchers may believe that with larger numbers of participants, results are better powered and become more accurate.  This belief is wrong, especially in low reliability environments.  The more critical design element is the number of trials per person within a task.  With few trials, there is much trial noise and much attenuation.  Low numbers of trials add systematic bias whereas low numbers of people add unsystematic noise.  Moreover, using high numbers of participants with low numbers of trials breeds high confidence in a wrong answer.  We recommend researchers consider running fewer tasks and conditions to gain larger numbers of trials per task.  Moreover, we recommend researchers stress the role of the number of trials in their discussion and report these numbers in their method sections, tables, and abstracts.

 *Stop Aggregating Trial Data / Use models that account for trial-level noise.*  These two recommendations go hand-in-hand.  We think most psychologists would like to honor the wisdom that aggregated data is less useful than disaggregated data.  Yet, to do so, one needs a plan to analyze disaggregated data.  For us, that plan is to use trial-level hierarchical models.  Throughout this paper, we have stressed that trial-level models may not recover correlations adequately.  Yet, at least the researcher has a built-in fail safe.  These models provide an estimate of how well or poorly correlations have been localized on a case-by-case basis.  It is this information on the precision that allows the researcher to place correlation recovery in context.  Moreover, without a trial-level model, we assuredly would have had high confidence in a bad answer.  We cannot stress this point enough---there is no loss in using models that account for trial variation.  Conversely, the loss from aggregating the data as sample effects is dramatic because the resulting degree of measurement error is large.  

The good news here is that individual difference researchers are well acquainted with hierarchical and latent variable models.  The models we use here are run-of-the-mill linear mixed models with normally-distributed errors.  Although we fit them in the Bayesian framework using `R` [@RCoreTeam:2018], there is nothing to prevent classical analysis.  Classical trial-level model analysis should be convenient in a wide variety of packages including `lme4`, `Mplus`, and `AMOS`.  Given the field's familiarity with mixed linear models and the accumulated expertise in application, the wide-spread use of trial-level hierarchical models is feasible.  Not using such models in this context strikes us as leaving money on the table.  

A caveat for researchers who use hierarchical models is needed.  These researcher should take care to understand the variability of parameters.  Resulting individual estimates are necessarily correlated from the hierarchical structure.  This correlation must be accounted for in constructing confidence intervals on individual-effect parameters.   Standard computations of confidence-intervals are based on independent observations.  With correlated observations, these  standard confidence intervals are biased too small and more advanced computational methods are needed [@Bryk.Raudenbush.1988]. In the Bayesian context, in contrast, estimating parameter variability is conceptually and computationally straightforward [@Gelman:etal:2004], and this advantage should not be overlooked.  
 
 *Don't Rely on Reliability.*  One maxim of individual-difference research is that correlations are interpretable with high reliability.  This maxim is quite helpful in the classical test case where each individual performs a standard instrument such as a standard depression inventory.  It is less helpful for experimental tasks.  While reliability can tell us about the expected attenuation in correlation, it cannot tell us about the uncertainty in correlation in a sample, and it is this uncertainty that has been problematic in the face of trial noise.  In simulation, even though we had some tasks with high reliability, we were unable to localize correlations as well as we would have hoped.  Hence, relying on high reliability to interpret correlations remains a risky proposition.

*Draw a Sharp Distinction Between Tasks and Measures.*  We have focused here on experimental tasks where there is a theoretically-motivated contrast between conditions.  The contrast is key---it allows isolation of the process of interest, say cognitive control, from other factors such as motivation or general speed.  The claim here is that correlations among tasks are difficult to recover.

The alternative is to use a measure rather than a task.  Measures have better statistical properties than tasks.  They are often highly reliable and lead to higher correlations among similarly-motivated measures [@Draheim:etal:2019;@Draheim.etal.2021].  We agree that it may be far easier to localize correlations with measures than tasks.  

For us, however, interpretability remains an issue. Whether a certain measure indexes a given process is asserted *prima facie* rather than by experimental logic.  Some assertions seem quite reasonable, say that performance on a span task indexes working memory [@Daneman.Carpenter.1980].  Others seem less reasonable.  We worry, for example, that antisaccade accuracy [@Kane.etal.2001] reflects the speed of detecting briefly flashed targets (general speed) as much as suppressing a cue located away from the target (cognitive control).  

Recently, @Draheim.etal.2021 recommended using tasks but dispensing with difference scores.  Instead, performance across the conditions are averaged rather than differenced. The downside of this approach, however, is a reduction in interpretability. When one dispenses with difference scores, one also dispenses Donders' subtractive logic for control of extraneous processes.  For example, it is not clear that condition averages in a Stroop task may be interpreted as indexing cognitive control.  These averages reflect the contribution of a host of processes and are likely dominated by a general speed component [@Salthouse:1996].  

In practice, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of what is a task and what is a measure if only because we tend to use "task" for both tasks and measures.  Popular measures such as the antisaccade accuracy measure and the stop-signal measure are routinely called tasks, but, in our usage, they are not.  Regardless of terminology, 
researchers need be aware of a foundational trade-off: tasks have high interpretability and poor statistical properties to index individual differences while measures have negotiated interpretability and good statistical properties.  We advocate tasks because of their interpretability.  Others will assuredly disagree.

## Strategies for Better Correlation Recovery

The above recommendations center on understanding how much variability and bias there is in recovering latent correlations.  But they do not address the difficult situation head on.  How can we improve the recovery?  We consider the following possibilities:

*More Trials.*  A seemingly simple solution is to run more trials per person per condition.  The usual 50 or 100 trials per task per condition is clearly not enough.  Here is a seat-of-the-pants calculation to show what might be ideal:   Suppose we wish to localize individual effects up to a maximum standard error of 10 ms.  With this value, we can calculate the number of needed trials.  If people have 200 ms of trial-level noise, and we are computing a difference score, then the standard error is $200\sqrt{2/L}$, where $L$ is the number of trials per condition per task.  Setting this standard error to 10 ms yields $L=800$, or about 1,600 trials per task per participant.  

Now such a large number will assuredly prove problematic for several reasons.  Participants tire and lose motivation. The target effects themselves may attenuate with excessive numbers of trials [@Davidson.etal.2003;@Dulaney.Rogers.1994]. Researchers may not have resources to run large number of trials per individual per task, and even if the resources are available, such designs may not be practical.

Still, at least from a statistical point-of-view, more trials is always better than less so long as those trials result in comparable behavior across the sessions.  Researchers using more trials do need to check for fatigue, loss of effect, loss of motivation and the like.   

As an aside, we recommend researchers never run neutral conditions.  The contrast between incongruent and congruent is far more important, and performance on neutral trials do not enter into correlational structures.  Removing neutral conditions allows for larger numbers of congruent and incongruent trials.  If researchers wish to critically assess whether the neutral condition is more like the incongruent or the congruent condition, they should do so outside an individual-differences design.

*Better Tasks.* Perhaps the most obvious solution is to search for inhibition tasks with greater individual variation.  In practice, this means engineering tasks to have large overall effects with relatively small trial noise.  Yet, as far as we know, there is no magic bullet to increase effect sizes.  Take, for example, manual Stroop tasks.  Outside of increasing the number of responses, we do not know how to increase the size of the effect.  And when the number of responses is increased, the trial variability may increase as well.  In summary, it is unclear at this time how to increase the size of effects over what is typically seen.

Another approach is to refine how we use dependent variables.  A new trend is to consider both speed and accuracy in combination [@Enkavi.etal.2019; @Hedge.etal.2021].  There are two possible advantages: first, by considering speed and accuracy jointly, individual differences in the speed-accuracy tradeoff may be considered and modeled.  Second, resulting parameters such as the rate of evidence accumulation may be more sensitive and less affected by trial noise than RT or accuracy alone.  Of course, these approaches may be used in a hierarchical context where the evidence-accumulation process model accounts for trial-by-trial variability and additional models on drift rate account for correlations across tasks [@Vandekerckhove.etal.2011].

*Confirmatory Models.*  One future direction is the development of trial-level confirmatory latent-variable models.  The approach we have taken here may be compared to exploratory factor modeling in as much as we add no constraints to the covariance matrix. Covariances are free to take on any values as long as the matrix meets the usual symmetry and positive-definite constraints.  In this sense, any factor structure is plausible, and as a result, we can think of the approach in Equation (\ref{eq:Sig}) as highly flexible. Yet, addressing substantive questions often does not require such flexibility.  We think the next step is to use models with greater constraint, that is, models that are comparable to confirmatory factor models.  For example, if we are interested in the basic question whether there is a unified concept of inhibition, we might develop a trial-level one-factor model or a trial-level bifactor model.  There are two related sanguine possibilities.  First, with the reduction of flexibility, it may be possible to better localize correlations among tasks.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, localization of correlations may become secondary to model assessment and model comparison.  How well does one trial-level confirmatory structure compare to another? 

Of course, comparison of confirmatory models is not at all new.  And while there has been a large corpora of studies, to our knowledge, none of the studies on task-based difference scores uses trial-level data.  Hence, the inputs to these models, the sample correlations, are already attenuated by trial noise.  The results with these confirmatory factor models to date have not been as productive as one might hope.  In a large-scale review, @Karr:etal:2018 compared results from seven leading factor models of executive function across 46 studies.  They found no clear winner--- no model fit well in more than half the studies and no model was selected in greater than one-third of the studies.  They conclude that there may be a tendency to publish well-fitting but underpowered models.  We offer as conjecture that by using more of the data and by modeling trial noise, trial-based confirmatory models may be more informative and productive than their classical counterparts.

## Concluding Thought

We show here that it is very difficult to address whether inhibition is a unified or disparate concept using individual differences with experimental tasks.  Simply put, we cannot as of yet tell if the low correlations with conventional aggregation are a result of measurement error or a true lack of covariation.  Without the benefit of better methods and experiments, we offer no critique of or advocacy for extant theories of cognitive control.

Solving the difficulties with tasks is going to entail larger experiments, perhaps better tasks, and trial-level latent-variable confirmatory models for analysis.  We hope this paper lays a foundation for understanding what is at stake and motivates the needed developments.  Although the message is disheartening in the short run, we think there is reason to be optimistic in the long run.  Given the talent in the field, individual-difference researchers are going to rise to the challenge because these solutions may well be within our grasp.

# Appendix

### Data Set 1, @vonBastian:etal:2015:
The task was a number Stroop task. Participants were presented a string of digits. In each string, the digits were always replicates, say *22* or *444*, and the lengths varied from one digit to four digits. The participants identified the length of the string, for example, the correct report for *444* is 3. In the congruent condition, the length and the digits matched; e.g., *22* and *4444*.  In the incongruent condition, the length and digits mismatched, e.g., *44* and *2222*.  We used somewhat different data cleaning steps than the original authors.  Ours are described in @Haaf:Rouder:2017.

### Data Set 2, @Hedge:etal:2018: 
The task was a color Stroop task.  Participants identified the color of a centrally presented word (red, blue, green, or yellow). In the congruent condition, presentation color and word meaning matched. In the incongruent condition, they did not match.  Following @Hedge:etal:2018, we combined data from their Experiments 1 and 2.  Our cleaning steps differed from @Hedge:etal:2018 and are described in the code accompanying @Rouder:Haaf:2019a.  Briefly, we discarded participants who had an error rate greater than 10%. 

### Data Set 3,  @Pratte:etal:2010, Experiment 1:  
The task was a color Stroop task. Participants identified the color of the color words, e.g. the word *RED* presented in blue. In the congruent condition, presentation color and word meaning matched, e.g. *BLUE* presented in blue. In the incongruent condition, they did not match, e.g. *RED* presented in blue.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

### Data Set 4, @Pratte:etal:2010, Experiment 2: 
The task was a sidedness judgment Stroop task.  Participants were presented the words *LEFT* and *RIGHT*, and these were presented to the left or right of fixation. Participants identified the position of the word while ignoring the meaning of the word. A congruent trial occurred when position of the word and word meaning corresponded; an incongruent trial emerged when position and word meaning did not correspond.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

### Data Set 5, @ReyMermet:etal:2018:
The task was a number Stroop task.  Participants identified the length of digit strings much like in Data Set 1.  Cleaning proceeded as follows. First, note that in the original, trials ended at 2.0 seconds even if the participant did not respond.  We call these trials *too slow*.  1. We discarded the five participants discarded by the original authors; 2. We discarded too-slow trials, error trials, and trials with RTs below .275 seconds (*too-fast* trials).  3. We discarded all participants who had more than 10% errors, who had more than 2% too-slow trials, or more than 1% too fast trials.  

### Data Set 6, @ReyMermet:etal:2018: 
The task was a color Stroop task. Participants identified the color of the presented words (red, blue, green, or yellow). The presentation color and word meaning matched in the congruent condition and did not match in the incongruent condition.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.


## Data Set 7, @Whitehead.etal.2019 (Experiment 1):
The task was a color Stroop task similar to Data Set 6.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

## Data Set 8, @Whitehead.etal.2019 (Experiment 2):
The task was a color Stroop task similar to Data Set 6.  The ratio of congruent-to-incongruent items was 3-to-1 rather than 1-to-1.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.


## Data Set 9, @Whitehead.etal.2019 (Experiment 3):
The task was a color Stroop task similar to Data Set 6.  The word-to-color contingencies were manipulated to remove certain feature overlaps.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.


### Data Set 10, @vonBastian:etal:2015:
The task was a Simon task.  Participants were presented either a green or red circle to the left or right of fixation.  They identified the color, green or red color by pressing buttons with their left or right hand, respectively. The spatial location of the circle and of the response could be either congruent (e.g., a green circle appearing on the left) or incongruent (e.g., a green circle appearing on the right).  Cleaning steps are described in @Haaf:Rouder:2017.

### Data Set 11, @Pratte:etal:2010, Experiment 1:
The task was a Simon task almost identical to that in Data Set 10.  Participants identified the color of a square presented to the left or right of fixation by making a lateralized key response.   A congruent trial occurred when position of the square was ipsilateral correct key response.; an incongruent trial occurred when the position of the square was contralateral to the correct key response. Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

### Data Set 12: @Pratte:etal:2010, Experiment 2: 
The task was a *lateral-words* Simon task.  Participants were presented the words *LEFT* and *RIGHT* to the left or right of fixation.  Participants identified the meaning of the word while ignoring the location of the word. A congruent trial occurred when position of the word and word meaning corresponded; an incongruent trial occurred when position of the word and word meaning did not match. Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

### Data Set 13, @Whitehead.etal.2019 (Experiment 1). 
The task was a location Simon task similar to @Pratte.etal.2010.  Directional words UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT were placed at locations.  Participants ignored the location and reported the meaning of the word.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

### Data Set 14, @Whitehead.etal.2019 (Experiment 2).  
The task was a location Simon task similar to Data Set 13.  The ratio of congruent-to-incongruent items was 3-to-1 rather than 1-to-1.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

### Data Set 15, @Whitehead.etal.2019 (Experiment 3) 
The task was a color Stroop task similar to Data Set 6.  The word-to-location contingencies were manipulated to remove certain feature overlaps.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

### Data Set 16, @vonBastian:etal:2015:
The task was a letter-flanker task.  Participants were presented strings of seven letters and judged whether the center letter was a vowel (*A*, *E*) or consonant (*S*, *T*).  The congruent condition was when the surrounding letters came from the same category as the target (e.g. *AAAEAAA*); the incongruent condition was when the surrounding letters came from the opposite category of the target (e.g., *TTTETTT*).  Cleaning steps are described in @Haaf:Rouder:2017.

### Data Set 17: @Hedge:etal:2018:  
The task was an arrow flanker task almost identical to Data Set 11.   Following @Hedge:etal:2018, we combined data from their Experiments 1 and 2.  Our cleaning steps differed from @Hedge:etal:2018 and are described in @Rouder:Haaf:2019a.  

### Data Set 18, @ReyMermet:etal:2018:
The task was an arrow flanker task.  Participants identified the direction of the central arrow (left/right) while ignoring four flanking arrows. Congruency and incongruency occurred when the center arrow matched and mismatched the direction of the flanker arrows, respectively.   Cleaning steps were the same for Data Set 5.

###  Data Set 19, @ReyMermet:etal:2018:  
The task was a letter-flanker task almost identical to Data Set 18.  Cleaning steps were the same for Data Set 5.


### Data Set 20, @Whitehead.etal.2019 (Experiment 1). 
The task was a letter flanker task where participants identified a central letter.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

### Data Set 21, @Whitehead.etal.2019 (Experiment 2).  
The task was similar to Data Set 20.  The ratio of congruent-to-incongruent items was 3-to-1 rather than 1-to-1.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

### Data Set 22, @Whitehead.etal.2019 (Experiment 3) 
The task was a letter flanker task similar to Data Set 20.  Target-to-distractor letter contingencies were manipulated to remove certain feature overlaps.  Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

### Data Set 23, @Rouder:etal:2005a:
The task was a digit-distance task.  Participants were presented digits 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and had judged whether the presented digit was less-than or greater-than five.  Digits further from five are identified faster than those close to 5.  Responses to digits 2 and 8 comprised the *far* condition; responses to digits 4 and 6 comprised the *close* condition.  The difference in conditions comprised a  *distance-from-five* effect.   Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.

### Data Set 24, @Rouder:etal:2010d:
The task was a grating-orientation discrimination.  Participants were presented nearly-vertical Gabor patches that were very slightly displaced to the left or right; they indicated whether the displacement was left or right.  Displacements were $\pm1.5^\circ$, $\pm2.0^\circ$, and $\pm4.0^\circ$ from vertical.  Responses from the $\pm1.5^\circ$ comprised the *hard* condition; responses from the $\pm4.0^\circ$ comprised the *easy* condition; the difference comprised a *orientation-strength* effect.   Cleaning steps were those from the original authors as implemented in their analysis code.
